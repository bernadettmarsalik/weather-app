# Current Weather App
This is a current weather app developed using React with Typescript, OpenWeatherMap API and styled with Bootstrap & CSS.

# Function
- This app can show the current weather including Celsius, wind speed and humidity
- It uses geolocation for showing current weather for user's location
- User can also search by city name for weather condition regionally

# Difficulties I had
- I have problems with getting user's geolocation in browser enabled but I could manage it successfully
- Refactoring the app from one component to be more ordered with individual components and util files

# Plans for the future to update this app
- I plan to update this app's search function with options for similar city names
- I would like to add weather forecast function in the future
